            <div class="abstract">
                <p>The CogVL workshop provides a forum for students and researchers across computer vision, natural language processing, and cognitive science to explore how cognitively inspired frameworks can enhance the robustness, generalization, and interpretability of VLMs. The workshop will feature invited talks by leading experts and a panel discussion examining how cognitive principles can reshape model architectures, learning paradigms, and evaluation methodologies.</p>
